This is the repository for Friday Night Rewrite, a full code rewrite of the original game Friday Night Funkin' by ninjamuffin99, PhantomArcade3K, and Kawaisprite. The modding community for this game is huge, and yet despite numerous engines (mods meant to make mods easier) being released, I still felt like making mods was really messy. The foundations of the codebase were so shaky, it just made more sense to start from the ground-up. Hence why I made Friday Night Rewrite.
